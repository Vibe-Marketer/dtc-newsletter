# Newsletter Context

Hey Andrew, Just wanted to fill you in on where things stand with the Morrisons and what we’re working with.

The Traffic Setup

The Morrisons are currently spending about $25,000/day on ads (which is actually pretty low for them – they want to ramp that up significantly). They’re sending all that traffic to the websites you see above where people opt in to learn how to create a store.

While people are on that list, the Morrisons are doing two things: getting them to register for Shopify through their affiliate link (that’s why they’re at the top of Shopify’s affiliate leaderboard), and offering done-for-you stores.
After about 2 weeks on their list, those subscribers get pushed over to our newsletter. So everyone coming to us is really fresh.

Our Audience

These folks are most likely pretty new to ecommerce. That doesn’t mean they’re unfamiliar with it, but they’re probably building a store for the first time. Los estimates about 80% would be pretty new to ecom. So as we’re creating newsletters and offering tools, we’ll keep in mind that these are probably newer folks. That said, it doesn’t mean we can’t try all kinds of different products.

What We Can and Can’t Promote

There are only two things we cannot promote: Shopify as an affiliate and done-for-you stores. Everything else is fair game – affiliated or otherwise. We’re not limited to ecommerce products either, but obviously it’s smart to have products tied to ecommerce or business in some fashion.

Tools sell really well. Templates, software, all that kind of stuff sells really well. Trainings could be okay, but people are starting to get tired of trainings. Anything ChatGPT-related – prompts, GPTs, etc. – would probably sell really well.

Monetization Strategy

Los and I are hoping to have a decent amount of internal products. That way we keep most of the money in-house, and we don’t have to wait 30-60 days to get paid on affiliate payouts. We’re trying to monetize this fast, and the Morrisons want to see money coming in quickly.

If we front-load it with affiliate stuff, we won’t have anything to show for it for a couple months before those payouts start hitting. But if we can create products and turn them fast, we’re in a much better position. We’re not worried about heavy support – if they’re simple tools, we can offer basic support.

We’re totally down for being affiliates too, but if we can find affiliate programs that pay way quicker than the typical 30-day cookie plus the next payment period (which usually ends up being 45-60 days total), that would be ideal. We just don’t want to wait that long at the beginning if we can avoid it.

The Bottom Line

Quick monetization, long-term monetization – we have to balance both. We obviously want to put good information out there and have content that naturally sells the products. Any products we can create in-house, the better. Simple tools work great – doesn’t have to be anything complex. Like a series of GPTs we could sell individually or bundle together. I think I sent you that list of the ones I was thinking about having created.

We also want to get sponsorships moving fast. We’d love to have the numbers first to prove ourselves, but financially we do have to step on the gas. We’re on a timeline. As much as it would be nice to prove ourselves and earn the right to sell things, if we don’t do it fast, we won’t have a list to work with.

So just things to keep in mind as we’re working on these. Appreciate all your help!
