Your biggest competitor just spent $847,000 on Facebook ads last month.

You can see every single one of their creatives, their top-performing hooks, and their exact targeting—completely free.

Two tools make this possible.

Your biggest competitor just spent $847,000 on Facebook ads last month. You're sitting there with your $500 daily budget wondering how the hell you're supposed to compete.

Here's what they don't want you to know: You can see every single one of their ads. For free. And steal their best performers in under 8 minutes.

The Facebook Ad Library is public. Every active ad is sitting there waiting for you to find it. But 99% of people use it wrong. They search their competitor's page name, scroll through 200 ads, and give up frustrated.

Smart operators use the "Issues, Elections or Politics" filter hack.

Switch the filter from "All Ads" to "Issues, Elections or Politics." Then switch it back to "All Ads." This resets Facebook's algorithm and shows you ads in chronological order - newest first. Now you're seeing their current winners, not random ads from 2019.

But here's the real move: Look for ads with high engagement but posted in the last 7-14 days. High engagement usually means high spend. Recent means it's working now, not last year.

Found a winner? Don't copy it word-for-word like an amateur. That's how you get your ad account flagged. Instead, steal the angle. If they're selling protein powder with "Finally, a powder that doesn't taste like chalk," your version becomes "The only protein that actually tastes like chocolate cake."

Same psychology. Different words. No copyright issues.

Take it further: Use the "See Ad Details" button. This shows you what countries they're targeting and what placements they're using. If they're spending heavy in Canada but you're only running US traffic, you just found a new market to test.

One DTC founder I know used this exact process to find his competitor's winning UGC creator. He reached out to the same creator, got a similar video made, and scaled it to $40k/day in spend within two weeks.

The whole process takes 8 minutes per competitor. Check 5 competitors weekly and you'll never run out of winning ad angles. While everyone else is guessing what creative to test next, you're stealing proven winners and improving them.

Your competition thinks their ads are secret. They're not. They're your free market research sitting in plain sight.

Last week I watched Quince's CEO break down how they built a $200M DTC brand. One detail stopped me cold. They don't compete on ads at all.

Instead, they built what he calls "defensible differentiation." While everyone else fights over the same Facebook placements, Quince went direct to factories. The same ones making $300 cashmere sweaters for luxury brands. They cut out 6 middlemen and sell the identical product for $50.

Here's the lesson most founders miss: You can't out-spend bigger brands. But you can out-position them. Quince didn't try to beat luxury brands at their own game. They redefined the game entirely. Same quality, different story, fraction of the price.

The tactical takeaway? Map your supply chain. Every middleman is a markup opportunity. Quince found 6 layers between factory and customer. Each layer added 40-60% to the cost. By going direct, they didn't just save money – they created an unbeatable value proposition.

Most DTC brands focus on creative, audiences, and optimization. All important. But if your unit economics don't work at scale, perfect ads won't save you. Quince proves that supply chain innovation beats advertising innovation every time.

Your homework: Audit your product costs. How many hands touch your product before it reaches customers? Each hand is a potential 50% markup. Find one to eliminate and you've just found your competitive advantage.

Found this last week and had to share. Most DTC brands are burning cash on Facebook's Learning Limited because they can't scale past $50/day without their CPMs going insane. Tool Placeholder fixes this by automatically identifying your winning creative patterns and suggesting variations that keep the algorithm fed. Here's what caught my attention: it doesn't just copy successful ads from your niche. It analyzes the psychological triggers in your best performers and creates new angles around those same triggers. The 7-figure brand I was consulting for tested it against their in-house creative team. Tool Placeholder's suggestions outperformed human creatives 3:1. The kicker? It takes about 10 minutes to set up and costs less than what most brands spend on one losing creative. I've been using it for three weeks and my client's account finally broke through that $500/day ceiling they'd been stuck at for months.

PS: Next week I'm breaking down the $2.1M product launch strategy I just watched go live. The positioning trick alone is worth the read.
