Your biggest competitor just spent $47,000 testing Facebook ads last month.

You can see every single one for free.

While they burned cash finding winners, you get to steal their best performers without spending a dime.

Your biggest competitor just spent $47,000 testing Facebook ads last month. You can see every single one of their winners for free.

Here's the problem most new dropshippers face. They burn through their budget testing ads that have already been proven losers. Meanwhile, successful brands are running the same winning creatives for months.

The solution is creative intelligence tools. Specifically, Facebook Ad Library combined with Minea or BigSpy.

This works because Facebook legally has to show you every active ad. The trick is knowing which ones are actually performing. High-performing ads run for 30+ days and appear across multiple placements. Losing ads get killed in 3-7 days.

Here's exactly how to do it:

Step 1: Go to Facebook Ad Library. Search your top 3 competitors by brand name. Filter to "All ads" and "Active ads only."

Step 2: Screenshot any ad that's been running for 20+ days. These are likely winners. Look for the "Started running on" date in the bottom corner.

Step 3: Open Minea (free plan works). Paste your competitor's Facebook page URL in the search. This shows you their estimated spend and engagement metrics.

Step 4: Sort by "Most likes/comments" in the last 30 days. High engagement usually means high performance.

Step 5: Model (don't copy) their top 3 performing creatives. Same angle, different execution. If they're running "unboxing" videos, make your own unboxing video.

I tested this with a fitness dropshipping client. Found a competitor's ad that had been running for 47 days straight. Made our own version of their "morning routine" concept. First test drove a 2.1x ROAS on day one.

The math is simple. They spent thousands finding what works. You spend 20 minutes modeling their proven winners.

Most important: Don't steal their exact creative. Model their structure, hook, and angle. Use your own product, your own footage, your own copy. Facebook's algorithm penalizes direct copies anyway.

You'll cut your testing phase from 2-3 months down to 2-3 weeks. Instead of burning $5,000 finding winning creatives, you'll find them for the cost of your time.

Start with your biggest competitor. The one running the most ads. They've done the expensive work for you.

Here's why Quince is quietly eating everyone's lunch in the basics category.

Most DTC brands chase trends. Quince did the opposite. They picked the most boring product category imaginable—basic cotton tees, cashmere sweaters, silk pillowcases—and made one simple bet: people will pay $50 for a $200 product if you prove it's actually the same thing.

Their founder spent two years flying to the same factories that make $300 sweaters for luxury brands. Same yarn. Same machines. Same quality control. The only difference? No designer markup. Instead of paying for a logo, customers pay for the actual product.

The genius move was the messaging. Quince doesn't say "cheap luxury." They say "radical transparency." Every product page shows the factory, the materials, even the cost breakdown. When you're selling a $50 cashmere sweater that feels like a $200 one, transparency becomes your biggest weapon.

Here's what most brands miss: commoditized products aren't a weakness if you own the story. Quince turned "boring basics" into "luxury without the markup." Same cotton tee. Completely different positioning.

The lesson isn't to copy Quince's products. It's to copy their strategy. Pick something everyone else avoids because it's "too competitive" or "too basic." Find the angle that makes boring feel revolutionary. Most of your competitors are chasing shiny objects. Sometimes the biggest opportunity is hiding in plain sight.

Found this last week and had to share before everyone catches on. Tool Placeholder is what the 8-figure brands quietly use behind the scenes while everyone else guesses at optimization. 

Here's the thing most people miss: you don't need more traffic if you can't convert what you already have. This tool does exactly what it says - saves you hours of manual work while actually increasing your conversion rates. No fluff, no promises of overnight success. Just solid functionality that works.

I've been testing it for two weeks now and the results speak for themselves. The time savings alone justify using it, but the conversion boost is what made me actually recommend it. Best part? It's not some overhyped startup tool that'll disappear in six months. Been around for years, just flies under the radar.

Worth checking out if you're serious about optimization over just throwing more ad spend at problems.

PS: Next week I'm showing you the $2.1M product launch framework that uses zero ads and takes 72 hours to execute.
