Your biggest competitor just launched a new product.

Within 60 seconds, you can see their exact traffic numbers, ad spend, and which products are selling best.

Two free tools make this possible.

Your biggest competitor just launched a new product. You're scrambling to figure out their traffic sources, ad spend, and whether you should pivot.

Here's what most people do: They manually check Facebook Ad Library, scroll through their competitor's social media, and maybe run a quick Google search. Takes hours. Finds nothing useful.

Smart operators use a different approach.

They set up automated competitor monitoring that does the detective work while they sleep. One founder I know discovered his competitor's $50,000/day winning ad creative within 2 hours of it going live. He created a variation, launched it the same day, and pulled $12,000 profit in the first week.

The trick is combining three free tools most people use separately.

Start with Facebook Ad Library for creative monitoring. But instead of checking manually, use a Chrome extension called AdSpy Alerts (free version works fine). Set it to ping you whenever your top 3 competitors launch new campaigns.

Next, connect Google Alerts for their brand mentions and product launches. Set up alerts for "[competitor name] + discount," "[competitor name] + review," and their exact product names. You'll catch their PR pushes, influencer partnerships, and seasonal promotions before your customers do.

Finally, use Wayback Machine's "Save Page Now" feature on their landing pages weekly. This archives their exact copy, pricing, and offers. When they change something, you'll see what worked before they optimized it away.

The real power happens when these three systems work together. You get a notification about a new ad, cross-reference it with recent PR mentions, then check their archived landing pages to see if they changed their offer structure.

Set this up once on a Sunday afternoon. Takes maybe 20 minutes total.

Within two weeks, you'll have a competitive intelligence system that most million-dollar brands don't even run. You'll spot their winning moves before they scale them. You'll see their failed experiments before they pivot away. You'll know their seasonal strategy before their customers do.

One warning: Don't copy everything. Use this intel to stay ahead of market trends, not to become a clone. The goal is strategic awareness, not creative theft.

Expected result: You'll catch 3-5 actionable competitive insights per month. Each insight prevents one major mistake or reveals one profitable opportunity. Do the math on what avoiding just one failed product launch is worth to your business.

Quince went from zero to $400M in revenue by doing one thing most DTC brands get backwards. They started with the supply chain, not the product.

Most founders pick a product, then hunt for manufacturers. Quince's founders spent months in factories across Mongolia, Peru, and Turkey. They weren't looking for products to sell. They were looking for world-class manufacturers who needed direct access to customers.

The breakthrough came in a cashmere factory in Mongolia. The same facility that makes $300 sweaters for luxury brands was willing to work with Quince for $50 retail. No middlemen. No brand markup. Just direct access.

Here's the part that matters for your business: Quince didn't compete on marketing. They competed on math. When your product costs 80% less to make than your competitor's, you can afford to lose money on customer acquisition while they're fighting for breakeven.

The supply-chain-first approach gave them three unfair advantages. First, unbeatable unit economics. Second, exclusive relationships with top-tier manufacturers. Third, a story that writes itself – luxury quality without luxury markup.

This isn't just about finding cheaper manufacturers. It's about reversing the typical product development process. Instead of asking "What can I sell?" ask "What can I make better and cheaper than anyone else?"

Your homework: Pick your top three product ideas. Instead of validating demand first, call manufacturers directly. Ask about their other clients. Ask about their capacity. Ask what products they wish they could sell direct-to-consumer. The best opportunities are hiding in their unused production capacity.

Found this last week and had to share. Tool Placeholder does something most DTC tools can't - it actually saves you time instead of creating more work. Here's what happened: I was helping a friend analyze their competitor's product launch strategy. Normally this takes hours of manual digging through ad libraries, traffic estimators, and spreadsheets. Tool Placeholder pulled everything in under 5 minutes. Traffic sources, estimated spend, top-performing creatives, even which influencers they're working with. The data accuracy is scary good. Not sure how this isn't more popular, but the founder told me they're keeping it under wraps while they perfect the algorithm. Makes sense - if every brand had this level of competitive intelligence, the playing field would get messy fast. Worth checking out before word spreads.

PS: Next week I'm breaking down the $127M brand that uses zero paid ads and still outgrows everyone else.
