# How to Create Your Custom GPT: Creative Testing AI

This guide walks you through creating your Custom GPT in ChatGPT.

## Prerequisites

- ChatGPT Plus or Team subscription (Custom GPTs require paid plans)
- Access to chat.openai.com

## Step 1: Access the GPT Builder

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click your profile icon in the bottom-left
3. Select "My GPTs"
4. Click "+ Create a GPT" or "Create"

## Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

1. **Name**: Enter the GPT name from `gpt_config.json`
   - Copy the `name` field value
   - Paste into the "Name" field in GPT Builder

2. **Description**: Enter the description
   - Copy the `description` field value
   - Paste into the "Description" field

3. **Profile Picture** (optional):
   - Upload a custom image or use DALL-E to generate one
   - Recommended: 512x512 pixels

## Step 3: Add Instructions

This is the most important step:

1. Click the "Configure" tab in GPT Builder
2. Find the "Instructions" text area
3. Open `INSTRUCTIONS.md` from this package
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents
5. Paste into the Instructions field

**Tip**: The instructions define how your GPT behaves. Don't skip or shorten them.

## Step 4: Add Conversation Starters

1. Scroll to "Conversation starters" section
2. Open `conversation_starters.txt`
3. Add each line as a separate starter
4. These appear as quick-start buttons for users

## Step 5: Configure Capabilities

Based on your `gpt_config.json` capabilities:

1. **Web Browsing**: Toggle ON if your config shows `"web_browsing": true`
   - Allows GPT to search the internet for current information

2. **DALL-E Image Generation**: Toggle ON if `"dall_e": true`
   - Allows GPT to create images

3. **Code Interpreter**: Toggle ON if `"code_interpreter": true`
   - Allows GPT to run Python code and analyze files

## Step 6: Add Knowledge Files (Optional)

If you have supplementary documents:

1. Click "Upload files" under Knowledge
2. Add PDFs, docs, or text files the GPT should reference
3. Files are searchable by the GPT during conversations

## Step 7: Test Your GPT

Before publishing:

1. Click "Preview" in the top-right
2. Try each conversation starter
3. Test edge cases and common questions
4. Verify the GPT follows your instructions

## Step 8: Save and Publish

1. Click "Create" or "Update" to save
2. Choose visibility:
   - **Only me**: Private, only you can use it
   - **Anyone with a link**: Share via link
   - **Public**: Listed in GPT Store (requires review)

## Troubleshooting

**GPT doesn't follow instructions well:**
- Ensure full instructions were pasted (check for truncation)
- Add more specific examples in the instructions
- Use phrases like "You MUST" and "NEVER" for critical rules

**Responses are too short/long:**
- Add explicit length guidance in instructions
- Example: "Provide responses of 200-400 words unless asked for more detail"

**GPT goes off-topic:**
- Add constraints in instructions
- Example: "If asked about topics outside [domain], politely redirect"
