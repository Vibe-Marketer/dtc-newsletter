## Product 1: AI Store Starter Pack (front-end)

**Who:** 80% beginners who *haven’t* bought DFY.  
**Promise:** “Use AI to launch your first Shopify store in 7 days without being a tech nerd.”

**Price to start:** $19 (intro), then nudge up 20% every ~50 sales until conversion drops. 

**What you actually sell:**

1. **AI Niche & Product Picker GPT**  
   - They type in interests / budget → GPT outputs 10 product ideas, basic margins, sample brand names.

2. **AI Store Copywriter GPT**  
   - Prompts that generate:
     - Home page copy  
     - 1–3 product descriptions  
     - About, FAQ, refund, shipping pages

3. **7‑Day Launch Checklist (PDF/Notion)**  
   - Day‑by‑day: pick product, sign up for Shopify (they already did), plug in copy, basic settings, go live.

4. **Bonus:** “Plug‑And‑Play Store Theme Setup Prompts”  
   - Literally: “Paste this into ChatGPT to get instructions for your theme, colors, and sections.”

This does **not** compete with DFY stores; it’s the DIY, low-ticket version of the same dream. Name it something like **“7‑Day AI Shopify Starter Pack.”** Use naming like the “14 Day Find Your Perfect Product Launch” style: short, time‑bound, outcome‑driven.

## Product 2: First 10 Sales Sprint (upsell)

**Offer it immediately after Starter Pack purchase + in follow-up emails.**

**Promise:** “Get your first 10 real orders in 30 days using simple ads and AI‑written content.”

**Price to start:** $49–$59, then raise by ~20% until revenue dips. 

**Deliverables:**

1. **Simple Traffic Plan**
   - 3 “dumb simple” ad setups (one interest, one broad, one retargeting) with screenshots.
   - 7‑day organic plan: 10 TikTok / Reels scripts focused on their product.

2. **AI Ad & Content GPT**
   - They paste in product + audience → gets:
     - 20 hooks  
     - 10 ad headlines  
     - 10 UGC script outlines  
     - 7 “friends & family” DM templates

3. **Revenue Engine Templates**
   - Abandoned cart, checkout, post‑purchase, and “launch weekend” email flows.

4. **Bonus:** “First 10 Orders Tracker”  
   - Simple sheet that tracks spend, clicks, and orders (helps them feel momentum).

This is literally “more help with what they just bought” with faster results and less effort, which is my favorite upsell pattern.

## Product 3: Ecom Prompt & Template Vault (continuity)

**Promise:** “New prompts, templates, and examples every month so you never stare at a blank ad or product page again.”

**Price:** $19 every 4 weeks (13 charges / year if you want the money‑model bump). 

Each 4‑week cycle they get:

- 30 fresh ad hooks + 10 UGC scripts  
- 2 product page teardowns (with “steal this” sections)  
- 4 promo/nurture emails  
- Any new GPTs you make for internal use

Sell it as a **bonus**: “Join the Vault today and get all back issues / current packs instantly,” which is classic continuity‑as-bonus positioning.

## How to “rip” this in the next 30 days

1. **Week 1:**  
   - Clone and re-skin your existing GPTs / templates into ecom versions for Products 1 & 2.  
   - Build simple Gumroad/Stripe checkouts + delivery pages.

2. **Week 2:**  
   - Write a 5‑email promo for Starter Pack to day‑15+ segment: announce, story, stack bonuses, FAQ, 24‑hour, last‑chance.  
   - Add one soft plug in every newsletter issue.

3. **Weeks 3–4:**  
   - Layer in the Sprint upsell page + email sequence.  
   - Launch the Vault to buyers only at first (continuity after they’ve bought once). 

You don’t need 20 products. You need **one clean ladder** built from assets you already have, then you hammer it with boring consistency while the Morrisons keep shoving 10–20k people a month into your world.
