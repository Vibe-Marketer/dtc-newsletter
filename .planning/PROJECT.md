# DTC Newsletter Automation System

## What This Is

A fully automated weekly newsletter system for DTC News (100K+ subscribers). The system researches trending e-commerce content, drafts newsletters in Alex Hormozi's voice, finds affiliate opportunities, and creates one sellable digital product per week — all producing Beehiiv-ready drafts that require only approval to publish.

## Core Value

Every week, a complete newsletter draft appears in Beehiiv with real data, proven format, and a monetizable product — requiring zero manual research or writing.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Newsletter content engine that pulls from TikTok Shop, YouTube, Twitter/X, Amazon, Reddit, Perplexity
- [ ] 5-section "DTC Money Minute" format enforced on every output
- [ ] Alex Hormozi voice/copywriting rules applied automatically
- [ ] Beehiiv API integration for draft creation
- [ ] Affiliate opportunity finder with commission rates and pitch angles
- [ ] Product Factory that creates one digital product per week (GPTs, prompt packs, frameworks, sheets, small tools)
- [ ] Product packaging (sales copy, pricing, deliverables) included
- [ ] 8 weeks of newsletters drafted manually before automation
- [ ] Scheduled automation (runs weekly without manual trigger)

### Out of Scope

- Done-for-you Shopify stores — Morrison's territory
- Shopify affiliate promotions — contractually restricted
- Live cohort programs — future phase
- Mobile app — web/email only

## Context

**The List:**
- 100,000 subscribers, growing 1,000-3,000/day
- 80%+ are brand-new to e-commerce, stuck at product research
- They want tools, not training — shortcuts over education
- Already in Morrison funnel for first 14 days, then hit DTC News

**Research Done:**
- Alex Hormozi email strategy: reward every action, one concept per email, $45 ROI per dollar
- Sabri Suby email principles: 80% value / 20% ask, plain text, personal not corporate
- Dennis Murphy call: audience pain points, product restrictions, timeline urgency

**Existing Assets:**
- `dtc-news-newsletter-strategy.md` — complete format and monetization strategy
- Offer Doc Framework (adaptable for e-com)
- Various GPTs that can be packaged
- Lovable expertise for store-building challenges

## Constraints

- **Platform**: Beehiiv (API integration required)
- **Voice**: Alex Hormozi style (short sentences, concrete examples, math-driven, zero fluff)
- **Format**: Plain text only, no HTML templates, no embedded images
- **Frequency**: 2x/week (Tuesday 10am, Thursday 8pm) to start
- **Monetization**: No Shopify affiliates, no done-for-you stores
- **Validation**: 8 manual executions before automation enabled

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Plain text only | ISP deliverability + personal feel per Sabri | — Pending |
| Hormozi voice | Specific, systematizable, proven with business audiences | — Pending |
| Product Factory weekly | Creates recurring asset library + monetization optionality | — Pending |
| 8-week buffer before automation | Validates system works, builds content runway | — Pending |
| Beehiiv draft (not auto-publish) | Human approval checkpoint before anything goes live | — Pending |
