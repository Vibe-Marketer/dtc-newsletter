<objective>
Add references to example workflows in README.md so users know they exist.

Purpose: Close gap from 03-VERIFICATION.md - "Examples are referenced in README or CLAUDE.md"
Output: Updated README.md with example workflow links in Learn More section

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add example workflow references to README.md Learn More section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Update the "Learn More" section in README.md to include links to the example workflows.

    Current Learn More section (lines 79-84):
    ```markdown
    ## Learn More

    - **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** - Full documentation (architecture, error handling, advanced features)
    - **[directives/_TEMPLATE.md](directives/_TEMPLATE.md)** - Template for new workflows
    - **[execution/_TEMPLATE.py](execution/_TEMPLATE.py)** - Template for new scripts
    ```

    Add two new entries BEFORE the template links to show the working examples:
    ```markdown
    ## Learn More

    - **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** - Full documentation (architecture, error handling, advanced features)
    - **[directives/csv_to_json.md](directives/csv_to_json.md)** - Example: Convert CSV files to JSON (no API needed)
    - **[directives/weather_lookup.md](directives/weather_lookup.md)** - Example: Look up weather via API (shows dotenv pattern)
    - **[directives/_TEMPLATE.md](directives/_TEMPLATE.md)** - Template for new workflows
    - **[execution/_TEMPLATE.py](execution/_TEMPLATE.py)** - Template for new scripts
    ```

    This placement makes sense because:
    1. Examples come after reference docs (so users understand the system first)
    2. Examples come before templates (so users see real examples before blank templates)
    3. The brief descriptions explain what each example demonstrates
  </action>
  <verify>
    grep -q "csv_to_json" README.md && grep -q "weather_lookup" README.md && echo "PASS"
  </verify>
  <done>
    README.md Learn More section includes links to both example workflow directives with brief descriptions
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing the task:
1. Run: `grep -A 10 "## Learn More" README.md` — should show both example links
2. Run: `grep "csv_to_json\|weather_lookup" README.md` — should show 2 lines
3. Verify links are valid: `test -f directives/csv_to_json.md && test -f directives/weather_lookup.md && echo "Links valid"`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md contains "csv_to_json" reference
- README.md contains "weather_lookup" reference
- Both references are hyperlinks to the directive files
- References are in the Learn More section
- Gap from 03-VERIFICATION.md is closed (Truth #8 now passes)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-example-workflows/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
