<objective>
Simplify README.md to a minimal entry point, audit and update all cross-references, then delete redundant documentation files.

Purpose: Complete the doc consolidation by creating a clean entry point and removing the 5 redundant files. After this plan, only README.md, CLAUDE.md (+ mirrors), and REFERENCE.md remain.

Output: Minimal README.md (<100 lines) + 5 files deleted (SETUP.md, QUICKSTART.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, FRAMEWORK.md, MIGRATION.md)

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README.md as minimal entry point (satisfies DOC-02, DOC-08)</name>

  Rewrite README.md to be under 100 lines with this structure:

  ```markdown
  # Agentic Workflows Template
  ## Build Once, Run Forever

  You describe what you want. The AI builds it. The workflow gets saved so you never rebuild it.

  ---

  ## Getting Started

  This is a **GitHub template repository**. Here's how to use it:

  ### Option 1: Use This Template (Recommended)

  1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page
  2. Select **"Create a new repository"**
  3. Name your repository and create it
  4. Clone your new repository locally
  5. Continue with setup below

  ### Option 2: Fork

  Use this if you want to pull future updates from this template.

  ### Option 3: Clone Directly

  ```bash
  git clone <this-repo-url> my-project
  cd my-project
  rm -rf .git && git init  # Start fresh git history
  ```

  ---

  ## Setup

  ```bash
  # 1. Set up environment
  cp .env.example .env
  # Edit .env with your API keys (at minimum: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

  # 2. Verify
  python execution/sync_agent_files.py --check

  # 3. Open in Claude Code
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
  # This flag allows Claude to run scripts without confirmation prompts
  ```

  ---

  ## How It Works

  **Three layers:**
  1. **Directives** - Plain English instructions (`directives/*.md`)
  2. **Orchestration** - AI makes decisions
  3. **Execution** - Python scripts do the work (`execution/*.py`)

  **First time:** "Build a workflow that scrapes competitor prices" -> AI researches, builds, saves

  **Every time after:** "Scrape competitor prices" -> AI finds directive, runs script, done

  **Key requirements:**
  - Under 100 lines total
  - "Getting Started" section with "Use this template" workflow as FIRST option (DOC-08)
  - Includes Fork and Clone alternatives for completeness
  - Recommends `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - Links to REFERENCE.md (not SETUP.md, QUICKSTART.md, etc.)
  - No links to files being deleted
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. `wc -l README.md` shows under 100 lines
  2. `grep "Getting Started" README.md` finds the section heading (DOC-08)
  3. `grep "Use this template" README.md` finds the button reference (DOC-08)
  4. `grep -E "Option 1|Option 2|Option 3" README.md | wc -l` shows 3 options (DOC-08)
  5. `grep "dangerously-skip-permissions" README.md` finds the flag
  6. `grep "REFERENCE.md" README.md` finds the link
  7. `grep -E "SETUP|QUICKSTART|ARCHITECTURE|FRAMEWORK|MIGRATION" README.md` returns nothing

  - README.md is under 100 lines
  - Has "Getting Started" section with template/fork/clone guidance (DOC-08 complete)
  - "Use this template" is first and primary option
  - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag is recommended
  - Links to REFERENCE.md for deep documentation
  - No references to files being deleted

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Audit cross-references, update remaining files, and delete old docs</name>
  <files>
    CLAUDE.md
    AGENTS.md
    GEMINI.md
    directives/_TEMPLATE.md
    SETUP.md (delete)
    QUICKSTART.md (delete)
    ARCHITECTURE.md (delete)
    FRAMEWORK.md (delete)
    MIGRATION.md (delete)
  </files>
  <action>
  This task combines audit, update, and delete into a single atomic operation.

  **Step 1: Search for ALL references to files being deleted:**
  ```bash
  grep -r "SETUP\.md\|SETUP guide\|setup guide" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  grep -r "QUICKSTART\.md\|quickstart" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  grep -r "ARCHITECTURE\.md\|architecture" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  grep -r "FRAMEWORK\.md\|framework\.md" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  grep -r "MIGRATION\.md\|migration guide" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  ```

  **Step 2: For each reference found, update immediately:**
  - In CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md: Replace any references to FRAMEWORK.md/ARCHITECTURE.md with "See REFERENCE.md"
  - In directives/_TEMPLATE.md: Update any doc references to point to REFERENCE.md
  - In any other files: Update or remove stale references

  **Step 3: After ALL updates complete, delete the old documentation files:**
  ```bash
  git rm SETUP.md
  git rm QUICKSTART.md
  git rm ARCHITECTURE.md
  git rm FRAMEWORK.md
  git rm MIGRATION.md
  ```

  **Step 4: Final verification (MUST pass before marking done):**
  ```bash
  # Ensure no orphaned references remain in tracked files
  grep -r "SETUP\.md\|QUICKSTART\.md\|ARCHITECTURE\.md\|FRAMEWORK\.md\|MIGRATION\.md" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
  ```
  This should return NO results.

  **Important:** Use `git rm` for tracked files to properly stage the deletion.

After completing all tasks, verify the full consolidation:

1. **File count check:**
   ```bash
   ls *.md | wc -l  # Should be 5: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, README.md, REFERENCE.md
   ```

2. **README is minimal:**
   ```bash
   wc -l README.md  # Should be under 100
   ```

3. **DOC-08 satisfied (Getting Started with template/fork/clone):**
   ```bash
   grep "Getting Started" README.md  # Should find section
   grep "Use this template" README.md  # Should find template option
   grep "Fork" README.md  # Should find fork option
   grep "Clone" README.md  # Should find clone option
   ```

4. **No orphaned references:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "SETUP\.md\|QUICKSTART\.md\|ARCHITECTURE\.md\|FRAMEWORK\.md\|MIGRATION\.md" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" | grep -v ".planning/"
   # Should return nothing
   ```

5. **Key content accessible:**
   ```bash
   grep "REFERENCE.md" README.md  # Should find link
   grep "dangerously-skip-permissions" README.md  # Should find flag
   ```
