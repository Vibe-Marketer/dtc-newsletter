<objective>
Update all documentation to state CLAUDE.md is the canonical source and Python 3.10+ is required.

Purpose: Eliminate documentation contradictions that confuse users and AI agents. Currently FRAMEWORK.md and README.md say AGENTS.md is canonical, but the code and decision is CLAUDE.md. SETUP.md says Python 3.8+ but code uses 3.10+ syntax.

Output: Consistent documentation that matches code behavior and project decisions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update canonical source references in documentation</name>
  <files>FRAMEWORK.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md</files>
  <action>
Update all references to canonical source from AGENTS.md to CLAUDE.md in these files:

**FRAMEWORK.md** (lines 54, 60):
- Line 54: Change `| AGENTS.md | Source of truth |` to `| CLAUDE.md | Source of truth |`
- Line 60: Change `**Source of truth:** AGENTS.md is always the canonical version. Edits go there first, then sync to others.` to `**Source of truth:** CLAUDE.md is always the canonical version. Edits go there first, then sync to others.`

**README.md** (line 75):
- Change `├── AGENTS.md              # AI instructions (source of truth)` to `├── CLAUDE.md              # AI instructions (source of truth)`
- Also update the line for AGENTS.md to indicate it's a mirror: `├── AGENTS.md              # AI instructions (mirror of CLAUDE.md)`

**ARCHITECTURE.md** (line 112):
- Change `├── AGENTS.md              # AI instructions (source of truth)` to `├── CLAUDE.md              # AI instructions (source of truth)`
- Also update AGENTS.md line to indicate it's a mirror

Search for any other occurrences of "AGENTS.md" + "source of truth" or "canonical" and update as needed.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run grep to confirm no contradictions remain:

```bash
# Should return CLAUDE.md references only (not AGENTS.md)
grep -n "source of truth" FRAMEWORK.md README.md ARCHITECTURE.md

# Should return no matches (AGENTS.md as canonical is wrong)
grep -n "AGENTS.md.*canonical\|AGENTS.md.*source of truth" FRAMEWORK.md README.md ARCHITECTURE.md || echo "Good: No AGENTS.md canonical references"
```
  </verify>
  <done>
All documentation files state CLAUDE.md as canonical source. No remaining references to AGENTS.md as source of truth.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Python version requirement in documentation</name>
  <files>SETUP.md</files>
  <action>
Update SETUP.md to require Python 3.10+ instead of 3.8+.

**SETUP.md** (line 12):
- Change `- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed` to `- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed`

Search for any other Python version references in the file and update them to 3.10+.

The rationale (from RESEARCH.md): Code uses PEP 604 union type syntax (`str | None`) which is only available in Python 3.10+. Python 3.8 reached EOL in October 2024.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run grep to confirm version is updated:

```bash
# Should show 3.10
grep -n "Python 3\." SETUP.md

# Should return no matches for old version
grep -n "Python 3\.8" SETUP.md || echo "Good: No Python 3.8 references"
```
  </verify>
  <done>
SETUP.md states Python 3.10+ requirement. No remaining references to Python 3.8.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Phase 1 success criteria addressed by this plan:
4. All docs that mention Python version say 3.10+ [Task 2]
5. All docs that mention canonical source say CLAUDE.md [Task 1]

Run full verification:
```bash
# Check canonical source - should only show CLAUDE.md as source
grep -rn "source of truth" FRAMEWORK.md README.md ARCHITECTURE.md

# Check Python version - should show 3.10
grep -rn "Python 3\." SETUP.md

# Negative check - these should return nothing
grep -rn "AGENTS.md.*source of truth" . --include="*.md" || echo "Pass: No AGENTS.md canonical refs"
grep -rn "Python 3\.8" . --include="*.md" || echo "Pass: No Python 3.8 refs"
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. FRAMEWORK.md states CLAUDE.md is canonical source
2. README.md states CLAUDE.md is canonical source
3. ARCHITECTURE.md states CLAUDE.md is canonical source
4. SETUP.md states Python 3.10+ requirement
5. No remaining references to AGENTS.md as source of truth
6. No remaining references to Python 3.8
</success_criteria>
