Write in a direct, confident tone for ecommerce entrepreneurs.
Use short sentences. Punch over polish.
Avoid corporate jargon and buzzwords.
Be specific - use numbers and concrete examples.
Never hedge with "might", "could", "perhaps".
Sound like a successful founder sharing what actually works, not a marketer trying to sell.
