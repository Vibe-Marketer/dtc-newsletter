## What NOT To Do

1. **Don't mention before value** - Always deliver something useful first
2. **Don't cluster mentions** - Space them out across sections
3. **Don't use aggressive language** - No "BUY NOW" or "LIMITED TIME"
4. **Don't force it** - If no natural fit, skip the mention
5. **Don't exceed 3 mentions** - Less is more (footer doesn't count)
6. **Don't repeat same product** - Vary which products you mention

---

## Tone Guidelines

**DO sound like:**
- "We use this daily, figured you'd want it too."
- "This is from our toolkit, happy to share."
- "If you want more, we've got you covered."

**DON'T sound like:**
- "ACT NOW! Limited spots available!"
- "You NEED this to succeed!"
- "Don't miss out on this incredible offer!"

The goal: Reader thinks "Oh cool, they have more of this" not "Ugh, another sales pitch."
