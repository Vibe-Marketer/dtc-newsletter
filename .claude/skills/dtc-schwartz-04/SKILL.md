description: Review newsletter copy using Eugene Schwartz's Breakthrough Advertising principles. Use to ensure awareness stage match, strengthen weak claims with verbalization techniques, and check three-dimension coverage.
---

<objective>
Analyze DTCNews newsletter drafts against Eugene Schwartz's Breakthrough Advertising principles.
Identify weak claims and provide strengthened alternatives using verbalization techniques.
Ensure copy matches the audience's awareness stage and covers all three persuasion dimensions.
</objective>

<dtcnews_context>
DTCNews serves aspiring ecommerce entrepreneurs learning to use AI tools for online business.

Audience awareness stage: Problem Aware to Solution Aware
- They KNOW they want income, freedom, escape from 9-5
- They KNOW solutions like Shopify and dropshipping exist
- They DON'T know our specific products or why they're best

Market sophistication: Stage 1-2 (Virgin to Second Mover)
- AI + Beginner Ecom is relatively new territory
- Direct benefit claims still work
- Mechanism explanations not yet required
- Can make bold promises if backed by proof

Implications for copy:
- Start with their problem or desire, lead to our solution
- Don't assume they know our products
- Direct claims work - no need for elaborate mechanisms yet
- Verbalization techniques add credibility without complexity
</dtcnews_context>

<awareness_analysis>
When reviewing copy, check that the headline and lead match the audience's awareness:

PROBLEM AWARE (most of our readers):
- Start with the problem they feel
- Good: "Still spending hours on product research?"
- Bad: "Our AI tool is the best" (assumes product awareness)

SOLUTION AWARE (some readers):
- Start with the solution category, differentiate your product
- Good: "There are dozens of AI writing tools. This one was built for product descriptions."
- Bad: "ACME Tool - $49" (assumes they know and want it)

Red flags in copy:
- Assuming reader knows what the product does
- Leading with product features before establishing desire
- Using jargon or terms they haven't learned yet
- Talking about "how it works" before establishing "why they need it"
</awareness_analysis>

<verbalization_techniques>
These 10 techniques transform weak claims into compelling copy.
Reference: data/schwartz_techniques.json for full database (22 techniques).

1. MEASURE THE SIZE
   Add specific numbers to quantify the claim.
   Weak: "Lots of prompts included"
   Strong: "47 prompts included in the pack"

2. MEASURE THE SPEED
   Add timeframes to show how fast results come.
   Weak: "Get product descriptions quickly"
   Strong: "Get your first product description in 30 seconds"

3. COMPARE
   Show contrast with alternatives using "Instead of X, you get Y".
   Weak: "Save time on research"
   Strong: "Instead of 3 hours researching, get answers in 3 minutes"

4. METAPHORIZE
   Make abstract concepts concrete with vivid imagery.
   Weak: "AI does the work"
   Strong: "This prompt does the heavy lifting for you"

5. SENSITIZE
   Make the reader feel, smell, touch, see, or hear it.
   Weak: "Make your first sale"
   Strong: "Imagine opening your phone to see your first sale notification"

6. DEMONSTRATE WITH EXAMPLE
   Show a prime example that proves the claim.
   Weak: "People get results"
   Strong: "Sarah used this exact prompt and got her first 3 sales in a week"

7. STATE AS PARADOX
   Something that seems contradictory but is true.
   Weak: "Easy to use even if you're not technical"
   Strong: "How a non-techie built a store in 48 hours"

8. REMOVE LIMITATIONS
   Show what the reader won't have to do or suffer.
   Weak: "Easy copywriting"
   Strong: "Write product descriptions without any copywriting skills"

9. BEFORE AND AFTER
   Contrast the two states explicitly.
   Weak: "Write descriptions faster"
   Strong: "Before: 3 hours writing one product description. After: 3 minutes."

10. CHALLENGE READER
    Turn it into a test or challenge.
    Weak: "AI writes like a human"
    Strong: "Can you tell which description was written by AI?"

Additional high-value techniques (see references/schwartz-techniques.md):
- Connect mechanism: Show HOW in the headline
- Dramatize: Show result in action with emotion
- Question format: Turn claim into engaging question
</verbalization_techniques>

<three_dimensions>
Every piece of copy should touch at least one dimension. Strong copy touches all three.

DESIRES (The Want)
Intensify physical, material, sensual wants. Give them a goal.
DTCNews desires: income, freedom, validation, escape 9-5, be own boss, work from anywhere

Check: Does copy paint a vivid picture of what they GET?
- Weak: "Make money online"
- Strong: "Wake up to sales that happened while you slept"

IDENTIFICATIONS (The Becoming)
The role they want to play, who they want to be seen as.
DTCNews identifications: successful entrepreneur, smart investor, ahead of the curve, tech-savvy, financially independent

Check: Does copy make them feel like the person they want to be?
- Weak: "Learn ecommerce"
- Strong: "Join the founders who figured this out early"

BELIEFS (The Framework)
Work WITHIN existing beliefs and prejudices - never fight them.
DTCNews beliefs: AI is the future, dropshipping works, passive income is possible, hard work pays off, there must be a faster way

Check: Does copy align with what they already believe?
- Weak: "Forget everything you know about business"
- Strong: "You already know AI is changing everything. Here's how to use it."
</three_dimensions>

<review_process>
Step 1: READ THE DRAFT
Read completely before analyzing. Note gut reactions.

Step 2: AWARENESS CHECK
- What awareness stage does this copy assume?
- Does the headline match Problem/Solution Aware?
- Does the lead establish desire before introducing product?

Step 3: CLAIM AUDIT
Identify every claim in the copy. For each:
- Is it specific or vague?
- Which verbalization technique could strengthen it?
- Write the strengthened version

Step 4: DIMENSION CHECK
Score each dimension (0-2):
- DESIRES: Does it paint what they get? (0=absent, 1=mentioned, 2=vivid)
- IDENTIFICATIONS: Does it show who they become? (0=absent, 1=implied, 2=explicit)
- BELIEFS: Does it work within their worldview? (0=conflicts, 1=neutral, 2=reinforces)

Step 5: REWRITE WEAK SECTIONS
For any claim scoring below "specific + technique-enhanced":
- Apply the most appropriate verbalization technique
- Provide 2-3 alternative versions

Step 6: FINAL REVIEW
- Does the strengthened copy still sound natural?
- Is it appropriate for Stage 1-2 sophistication (not over-engineered)?
- Would a beginner understand every word?
