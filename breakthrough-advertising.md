# BREAKTHROUGH ADVERTISING - Deep Extraction
## The $700 Insights Most People Miss

**Source:** Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz
**Extraction Method:** 3-Pass Deep Analysis

## INSIGHT #1: THE DESIRE CHANNELING PRINCIPLE (You Cannot Create Desire)

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Most marketers believe their job is to create desire for their product. Schwartz reveals this is fundamentally impossible. Mass desire already exists - it was created by forces outside of advertising (technology, culture, economics). Your job is not to create desire, but to CHANNEL existing desire toward your product. This is why even the best copy cannot sell a product nobody wants - but mediocre copy can sell a product everyone already craves.

**The Mechanism:**
1. Identify the pre-existing mass desire in your market (health, wealth, status, security, etc.)
2. Determine the STRENGTH of that desire - measured by how many people share it and how urgent it feels
3. Find the DIRECTION that desire is already flowing
4. Position your product as the inevitable destination of that flow
5. Your copy becomes a channel, not a creator - it shapes and directs energy that already exists

**How to Apply:**
- Before writing ANY copy, list the 3 dominant desires your market already has (not related to your product)
- Rank them by intensity (which keeps them up at night?)
- Ask: "How does my product become the logical fulfillment of their #1 existing desire?"
- Write headlines that acknowledge the desire FIRST, then bridge to your product SECOND

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This completely inverts the common approach. Instead of trying to convince people to want your product, you reverse-engineer FROM what they already want. You stop pushing and start redirecting. The energy expenditure drops dramatically while conversion increases.

**Quote from Book:**
"The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."

## INSIGHT #2: THE 5-STAGE MARKET SOPHISTICATION EVOLUTION

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Markets don't just have "awareness levels" - they evolve through 5 distinct sophistication stages, and each stage requires a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT headline strategy. Using the wrong strategy for your market's stage is why most ads fail - not because the copy is bad, but because it's addressing the wrong stage.

**The Mechanism:**

**Stage 1 (Virgin Market):** Be first. Be simple. Be direct. Just state the claim.
- "LOSE UGLY FAT!"

**Stage 2 (Second Mover):** Enlarge the claim. Outbid. Push to limits.
- "LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS - OR RECEIVE $40 BACK!"

**Stage 3 (Claims Exhausted):** Shift from WHAT to HOW. Introduce the MECHANISM.
- "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"

**Stage 4 (Mechanism Wars):** Enlarge/elaborate the mechanism.
- "FIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!"

**Stage 5 (Total Exhaustion):** Abandon product/mechanism entirely. Use IDENTIFICATION.
- "WHY MEN CRACK..." (Postum ad - never mentions the product directly)

**How to Apply:**
1. Research your competitors' current headlines
2. Map them to the 5 stages
3. Identify which stage your market is CURRENTLY in
4. Write copy for THAT stage (not the stage you wish it was in)
5. If in Stage 5, stop selling the product and start selling identification with the prospect

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This explains why copy that worked 6 months ago stops working. Markets evolve. The "killer headline" that crushed it at Stage 2 will FAIL at Stage 4 - not because it's bad copy, but because the market moved on. You must evolve with it.

**Quote from Book:**
"A headline that will work to a market in one stage of sophistication will not work to a market in another stage of sophistication."

---

## INSIGHT #3: THE MECHANISM PIVOT - When Claims Stop Working

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
When your market stops responding to bigger claims, don't make BIGGER claims - introduce HOW. The mechanism (the process by which your product delivers the benefit) becomes MORE IMPORTANT than the benefit itself. This is counterintuitive because most marketers think benefits sell - but in sophisticated markets, mechanisms sell.

**The Mechanism:**
1. Claims reach "believability ceiling" - prospects have heard "lose 50 lbs" so many times it means nothing
2. Instead of promising MORE results, reveal the PROCESS that creates results
3. The mechanism creates differentiation without requiring bigger claims
4. Mechanism also creates BELIEVABILITY - "if I understand HOW it works, I believe it works"

**Headline Evolution Example:**
- Stage 2 Claim: "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE"
- Stage 3 Mechanism: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"
- Stage 4 Elaborated Mechanism: "FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!"

**How to Apply:**
1. Write your current benefit-focused headline
2. Ask: "What is the PROCESS that makes this benefit possible?"
3. Name that process in a visceral, visual way ("floats," "melts," "burns," "flushes")
4. Put the mechanism IN the headline, with the benefit in the subhead
5. Test mechanism-first vs benefit-first headlines

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This solves the "I've tried everything" problem. When benefits stop converting, marketers typically try BIGGER benefits (which feels like hype). Schwartz shows the pivot should be LATERAL (to mechanism) not VERTICAL (bigger claims).

**Quote from Book:**
"Here the emphasis shifts from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant."

---

## INSIGHT #4: THE IDENTIFICATION HEADLINE - Selling to the Completely Unaware

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
For completely unaware or resistant markets, you cannot mention: price, product, function, OR desire in your headline. What's left? The MARKET ITSELF. You call your market together by echoing who they ARE, not what they want. This creates identification before any selling begins.

**The Mechanism:**
1. Your headline tells prospects WHAT THEY ARE
2. You're defining them for themselves, giving words to feelings they haven't articulated
3. The headline's only job is to get them to read paragraph 2
4. Paragraph 2 pulls them to paragraph 3, etc.
5. Desire and product appear ONLY after identification is established
6. Copy builds from identification -> awareness of problem -> realization solution exists -> your product

**Classic Examples:**
- "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NIGHT" (correspondence courses - calls to strivers)
- "WHY MEN CRACK..." (Postum - identifies with overworked executives)
- "WITHIN THE CURVE OF A WOMAN'S ARM" (deodorant - starts with beauty, not body odor)
- "THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO" (identifies with wanting social triumph)

**How to Apply:**
1. Describe your ideal customer's INTERNAL STATE (not demographics)
2. What do they secretly believe about themselves?
3. What struggle are they having that they don't talk about?
4. Write a headline that MIRRORS that internal state back to them
5. Lead them from recognition -> problem awareness -> solution -> your product

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This is the nuclear option for saturated markets. When you can't sell WHAT you do, sell WHO your customer is. It bypasses all sales resistance because you're not selling - you're recognizing.

**Quote from Book:**
"What you are doing essentially in this fifth stage is calling your market together in the headline of your ad. You are writing an identification headline. You are selling nothing, promising nothing, satisfying nothing. Instead, you are echoing an emotion, an attitude, a dissatisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds them together in a single statement."

## INSIGHT #5: THE PREVENTION HEADLINE PARADOX

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Prevention headlines (about problems that MIGHT happen) generally fail - but there's one exception that makes them work brilliantly. A person cannot visualize disasters happening to THEMSELVES, but they CAN visualize disasters happening to people they love. Prevention copy must target the LOVED ONE, not the prospect.

**The Mechanism:**
1. Humans have psychological resistance to imagining their own misfortune
2. But they readily imagine (and fear) misfortune for their children, spouse, parents
3. Prevention products must redirect the threat from prospect to loved one
4. The prospect becomes the HERO who prevents the disaster - much more appealing role

**Classic Examples:**
- Toothpaste: "LOOK, MOM - NO CAVITIES!" (child's benefit, not parent's)
- Life insurance: Never show the prospect dying - show the widow struggling to pay bills
- Child safety products: Show the child in danger, parent as rescuer

**How to Apply:**
1. List all the negative outcomes your product prevents
2. For each: ask "Who would this ACTUALLY hurt if it happened to my prospect?"
3. Rewrite the threat targeting that loved one
4. Position the prospect as the protector/provider/hero
5. Never show the prospect as the victim

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This explains why so many prevention ads fail. "Protect YOURSELF from..." triggers psychological denial. "Protect YOUR CHILDREN from..." triggers powerful protective instincts. Same product, radically different response.

**Quote from Book:**
"To sum up: A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to himself, but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying preventatives from, the image of such future problems affecting others around him."

---

## INSIGHT #6: VERBALIZATION - The Art of Saying the Same Thing Differently

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
The content of your headline is only HALF the battle. HOW you state that content can multiply its impact by 10x. Verbalization is the science of expressing the same claim in increasingly powerful ways - not changing WHAT you say, but transforming HOW you say it.

**The Mechanism:**
38 specific verbalization techniques exist, including:

1. **Measure the claim:** "20,000 FILTER TRAPS IN VICEROY!"
2. **Measure the speed:** "IN TWO SECONDS, BAYER ASPIRIN BEGINS TO DISSOLVE"
3. **Compare the claim:** "SIX TIMES WHITER WASHES!"
4. **Metaphorize:** "MELTS AWAY UGLY FAT!" (not "removes")
5. **Demonstrate with example:** "AT 60 MILES AN HOUR, THE LOUDEST NOISE IN THIS ROLLS ROYCE IS THE ELECTRIC CLOCK"
6. **State as paradox:** "HOW A BALD-HEADED BARBER SAVED MY HAIR!"
7. **Remove limitations:** "SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY!"
8. **Turn into challenge:** "WHICH TWIN HAS THE TONI?"
9. **Project ultimate triumph:** "THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO..."
10. **Address people who CAN'T buy:** "IF YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN YOUR VACATION, DON'T READ THIS"

**How to Apply:**
1. Write your bare claim in its simplest form
2. Apply each of the 38 techniques to that claim
3. Generate 10-20 variations
4. Score each on: specificity, emotional impact, believability, freshness
5. Test the top 3-5 against each other

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
Most copywriters write 2-3 headline variations. This system generates 38+ from a single claim. You're no longer hoping for inspiration - you're systematically engineering impact.

**Quote from Book:**
"Verbalization... is the art of increasing the impact of a headline by the way in which it is stated."

---

## INSIGHT #7: THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR PROSPECT'S MIND

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Your copy must work across THREE separate dimensions of cognition, not just one. Most copy addresses only Desire. But Identification and Belief are equally important - and addressing all three creates compound persuasion effects.

**The Mechanism:**

**Dimension 1: DESIRES**
- Physical, material, sensual wants
- These are the obvious drivers (health, wealth, status)
- Your job: sharpen, intensify, give them a goal

**Dimension 2: IDENTIFICATIONS**
- The roles your prospect wants to play
- The personality traits they want to project
- The social groups they want to belong to
- NOT stated directly - communicated through who uses the product

**Dimension 3: BELIEFS**
- Existing prejudices, knowledge fragments, reasoning patterns
- The FILTER through which your claims must pass
- You cannot fight these - you must work WITHIN them

**How to Apply:**
For each piece of copy, check:
1. Have I intensified their DESIRE for the result?
2. Have I shown them the IDENTITY they'll have as a user?
3. Have I worked WITHIN their existing BELIEFS about what's possible/true?

All three must align. Miss one, and the sale falls apart.

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This explains "good copy that doesn't convert." The desire may be inflamed, but if the identity doesn't fit or the belief system rejects the claim, no sale. Three locks, three keys.

**Quote from Book:**
"Desires... Identifications... Beliefs. Each of them composed of equal parts of emotion and thought. The three dimensions of your prospect's mind - the raw materials with which you will work."

---

## INSIGHT #8: INTENSIFICATION - The 13 Ways to Strengthen Desire

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
The gap between "interested" and "buying" is crossed by INTENSIFICATION - the systematic multiplication of desire through specific techniques. This isn't about hype; it's about presenting the same core benefit from multiple angles until resistance collapses.

**The Mechanism:**
Intensification techniques include:

1. **Direct detailed description** - make them see, feel, touch it
2. **Show results in action** - demonstrate the outcome vividly
3. **Bring in the reader as participant** - "imagine YOU walking into..."
4. **Show contrast** - before/after states
5. **Stack benefits** - layer satisfaction upon satisfaction
6. **Use specifics** - "4,076 roses" not "thousands"
7. **Tie to time** - "week after week, day after day"
8. **Create sensory experience** - color, texture, sound, smell
9. **Social proof projection** - "your neighbors will..."
10. **Future pacing** - "imagine next summer when..."

**How to Apply:**
1. State your core benefit in one sentence
2. Apply each intensification technique to that benefit
3. Write 2-3 paragraphs using each technique
4. Arrange in ascending emotional order
5. The cumulative effect creates buying urgency that no single statement could achieve

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This turns "feature/benefit" copy into experiential persuasion. You're not listing reasons to buy - you're building a vivid alternate reality where ownership already exists.

**Quote from Book:**
"Your job is to fill out these vague desires with concrete images - to show your prospect every possible way that they can be fulfilled - to multiply their strength by the number of satisfactions that you can suggest to achieve them."

---

## INSIGHT #9: THE WORD-SUBSTITUTE TRAP (Why Swipe Files Fail)

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
There are THREE levels of creative approaches to headlines. The first (Word-Substitute) is the most common and most ineffective. This is the swipe file method - taking proven headlines and replacing product names. It usually fails because it ignores the unique product-market-timing relationship.

**The Mechanism:**

**Level 1: Word-Substitute (Shallow)**
- Copy successful headlines, swap out product names
- Creates "Echo Ads" that remind people of OTHER products
- Ignores that the original worked due to unique market conditions
- "I'D WALK A MILE FOR A CUP OF BLANK COFFEE!" (doesn't work)

**Level 2: Formulas (Medium)**
- Memorize rules (use numbers, ask questions, include benefits)
- Better than copying, but still forces ideas into others' molds
- The idea demands its own shape

**Level 3: Analytical (Deep)**
- Start from the unique product-market-timing relationship
- Use guideposts and questions, not answers
- Build the solution that exists ONLY for this situation
- Produces true breakthroughs

**How to Apply:**
1. Stop using swipe files as templates
2. Use them only as INSPIRATION for what's possible
3. For every product, start with: "What is UNIQUE about this product in THIS market at THIS moment?"
4. The solution exists only within that relationship
5. Accept that each ad requires fresh creative work

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This challenges the entire "swipe file" industry. Schwartz says copying is what CLIENTS do, not copywriters. The solution to the unique lies only in itself - formulas and templates will always produce mediocrity.

**Quote from Book:**
"The true copy writer must argue with success - he must push on past it every time he faces a new product. In advertising, as well as in science and in art, the solution to the unique lies only in itself."

---

## INSIGHT #10: THE PRODUCT PERSONALITY PRINCIPLE

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Products have complete PERSONALITIES in the consumer's mind - complex, multi-trait identities like people have. But in your headline, ONE trait must SUMMARIZE and EXPRESS that entire personality. This "summary trait" becomes your campaign's anchor.

**The Mechanism:**
1. List ALL the traits/benefits of your product (10, 20, or more)
2. Identify which single trait SUMMARIZES the entire personality
3. This trait may not be the biggest benefit - it's the one that SYMBOLIZES the whole
4. Feature this summary trait in headlines
5. Blend other traits in body copy, but always relating back to the summary trait

**Example - Cadillac:**
- Traits: Quality, prestige, performance, appearance, comfort, resale value, freedom from repairs
- Summary Trait: QUALITY
- All other traits are presented as manifestations of quality
- Every ad reinforces the central quality theme

**How to Apply:**
1. List every benefit/trait of your product
2. Ask: "Which one, if I could only communicate ONE thing, would best represent the whole?"
3. Make this your headline theme across campaigns
4. Use other traits to add variety, but always tie back
5. Your ads become expansions of this single crystallized identity

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
Most marketers try to communicate EVERYTHING about their product. Schwartz shows that focus beats volume - one perfectly chosen trait, hammered consistently, builds more equity than scattered features ever could.

**Quote from Book:**
"One of these traits will always be the most effective in summarizing and expressing this personality... This summary trait is featured in a series of headlines, or headline illustrations - perhaps blended with one or two of the other traits to give it variety but always strengthening those other traits by interrelating them to this one dominant quality."

## BONUS INSIGHT: THE AWARENESS SCALE - 5 STAGES OF PROSPECT AWARENESS

**The Non-Obvious Truth:**
Beyond market sophistication, each INDIVIDUAL prospect exists on a 5-stage awareness scale. Your headline must meet them at THEIR stage, or it will fail completely - not because it's bad, but because it's mismatched.

**The Mechanism:**

**Stage 1: Most Aware**
- Knows product, knows what it does, knows they want it
- Headline: Just name it and state the deal
- "DIAL SOAP - 90 CENTS A CAKE"

**Stage 2: Product Aware**
- Knows product but not convinced it's right for them
- Headline: Prove your product is the best
- Focus on differentiation, proof, testimonials

**Stage 3: Solution Aware**
- Knows solutions exist, doesn't know your product
- Headline: Start with the solution, lead to your product
- "WHO ELSE WANTS A WHITER WASH - WITH NO HARD WORK?"

**Stage 4: Problem Aware**
- Has the problem, doesn't know solutions exist
- Headline: Start with the problem
- "CORNS?" or "DO YOU MAKE THESE MISTAKES IN ENGLISH?"

**Stage 5: Completely Unaware**
- Doesn't know they have the problem
- Headline: Cannot mention problem, solution, OR product
- Must use identification
- "WHY MEN CRACK..." or "THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN..."

**How to Apply:**
1. Segment your audience by awareness stage
2. Write different copy for each stage
3. Run different ads/landing pages for different awareness levels
4. Cold traffic = Stage 4-5 copy; Warm traffic = Stage 1-2 copy
5. NEVER use Stage 1 copy on Stage 5 prospects (it will fail catastrophically)

**Why This is Mind-Blowing:**
This explains why one funnel can produce wildly different conversion rates from different traffic sources. The copy isn't wrong - it's just written for the wrong awareness stage.

**Quote from Book:**
"Each of these stages is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference; on the other, intense interest."

---

## SUMMARY: THE SCHWARTZ SYSTEM

The $700 insight: **Advertising is not about your product. It's about the pre-existing desires in your prospect's mind, their current stage of awareness, their market's stage of sophistication, and the three dimensions of their psychology (desire, identification, belief).**

Your job is:
1. Channel existing desire (not create it)
2. Meet them at their awareness stage
3. Adapt to their market's sophistication stage
4. Work across all three mental dimensions
5. Intensify desire through systematic techniques
6. Verbalize claims for maximum impact
7. Build unique solutions for unique situations

This is not copywriting as "word-smithing." This is copywriting as STRATEGIC PSYCHOLOGY.

### THE "GRADUALIZATION" TECHNIQUE - Full Detail

**Definition:** Gradualization is the art of starting with facts your prospect is already willing to accept, and leading him logically and comfortably through a gradual succession of more and more remote facts—each of which he has been prepared in turn to accept.

**The Core Principle:**
Every claim, every image, every proof in your ad has TWO separate sources of strength:
1. The content of that statement itself
2. The preparation you have made for that statement—either by recognizing preparation already existing in your prospect's mind, or by deliberately laying the groundwork in the preceding portion of the ad

**The Architecture of Belief:**
- Belief ultimately depends upon STRUCTURE
- Just as desire depends upon promise, belief depends upon the preparation that promise has been given BEFORE your reader is asked to accept it
- One fully-believed promise has TEN TIMES the sales power of ten partially-believed promises

**Key Gradualization Devices:**

**1. The Inclusion Question**
Designed to permit immediate identification. Shows the prospect you're talking about HIM.
Example: "ASK YOURSELF THESE NINE QUESTIONS: 1. Do you find it increasingly difficult to cope with the world around you..."

**2. Detailed Identification**
Instead of questions, you detail symptoms or problems that are your prospect's reasons for desiring your product.
Example: "I don't care whether your child is six years old or twenty—boy or girl—in grade school, high school or college. It makes no difference how badly that child is doing in school today..."

**3. Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs**
Used at the beginning of the ad. You come out and say, "I know you think this is true; but I'm going to show you it's false."
Example: "From this moment on, forget everything you have ever heard or read about what age 'must do' to your appearance..."

**4. The Language of Logic**
Interlace each new promise with language-signals that show it logically follows from everything proved before.
Key phrases:
- "This has been proved by thousands..."
- "Sound impossible? Not at all. It's actually as simple..."
- "Here's why..."
- "And, most important of all, is the fact that..."
- "Therefore..."
- "This was, without a doubt, the most thorough..."
- "They discovered—in case after case—that..."

**5. Syllogistic Thinking**
The role that reason plays in your ad. You prove that your product works through the mechanism of logical reasoning.

**6. Other Belief Forms:**
- Contingency Structures: "If... then...", or "Was your... then..."
- Repetition of Proof: Echoing—"These experts found... These experts found... These experts found..."
- Promise—Belief—Promise Variation: Every sentence of promise followed with proof or verification
- Paragraph Parallelism: Same word structure used in an accepted statement is picked up exactly for a fresh claim

**The Goal Conclusion:**
Gradualization leads your reader to a "goal conclusion"—a conclusion he will accept, but which he would not as readily have accepted without the preliminary statements.

---

### THE "MECHANIZATION" TECHNIQUE - Full Detail

**Definition:** The verbal proof that your product does what you claim—answering the vital question: "How does it work?"

**Three Stages of Mechanism:**

**Stage One: Name the Mechanism**
When your mechanism is already well-known, simply name it.
Example:
```
TAKE FOOLPROOF PHOTOS WITH THE XENOPHON 1750
With Electronic Light Setter... Push-Button Zomar Lens... Magazine Load... Only $135.
```
The mechanisms are simply named, not described. Use this for catalog copy and retail copy dealing with products already known.

**Stage Two: Describe the Mechanism**
When the mechanism is not well-known, go into more detail.
Example (Rinso 1926):
```
Dirt floats off—stains go.
The secret is simply Rinso—a mild, granulated soap that gives rich, lasting suds even in the hardest water.
Just soak the clothes in the creamy Rinso suds—and the dirt and stains float off...
```
Key Rule: Mechanism copy is NOT scientific discourse. Never allow it to become dull or merely factual. Load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in mechanism copy SELLS.

**Stage Three: Feature the Mechanism**
When your market is highly sophisticated, mechanism becomes so important you must put it into the headline.
Examples:
- "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY."
- "FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING."
- "RUN YOUR CAR WITHOUT SPARK PLUGS."
- "SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."
- "TOMMY ARMOUR SAYS SMACK HELL OUT OF THE BALL WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND."

**The Mechanism for Price Cuts (Robert Collier's Method):**
Price cuts must be JUSTIFIED. There must be a reason—a mechanism—behind them.

Example:
```
Before the Price Goes Up!
Dear Sir:
A short time ago one of the old, reliable mills that makes the finer qualities of woven Madras for shirts began sending out S.O.S. calls.
They had kept their plant going steadily for months, thinking that the usual demand would easily take care of their excess output.
But, with the weather so generally unseasonable, the usual demand didn't materialize. And there they were, heavily overstocked—and needing money.
If we would take all their surplus stock... they offered to let us have them at way below any price we had ever paid...
```

### THE "CONCENTRATION" TECHNIQUE - Full Detail

**Definition:** The process of pointing out weaknesses in the competition, emphasizing their disservice to your prospect, and then proving that YOUR product gives him what he wants without those weaknesses.

**The Critical Rule:**
Never attack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time! If you can only attack another product—without showing how yours provides what the other lacks—then say nothing at all.

**Why This Works:**
Your prospect knows your attack is biased. If you're attacking only for your own good, you evoke skepticism and dislike. But if you show the attack is FOR HIS GOOD—because your product eliminates the weakness—you have a sales story he will accept.

**Two Concentration Structures:**

**Structure 1: Point-by-Point Contrast**
Bad.
Good.
Bad.
Good.
Bad.
Good.

Example (Fire Injectors vs. Spark Plugs):
```
A spark plug jumps a spark of electricity across an air gap. This is the most wasteful and power consuming way to get electricity from one place to another and it limits the size of the spark.

A fire injector fires on the surface of an electrical conductor. This is the most efficient way to get a big powerful spark into your cylinder.

On ordinary spark plugs the air gap between the electrode and the firing point is always getting bigger because the electrode is always burning away. This means you have misfiring which means loss of power plus wasted gas...

On fire injectors there is no air gap and no electrode to burn away. That means maximum gas explosion which means full power, full economy...
```

**Structure 2: Time Sequence (The Unpleasant Experience)**
- What happens to you NOW with products you're currently using
- What will happen when you SWITCH to the new product

Example (Reducing Pills):
```
For years doctors have known that ordinary reducing plans—that you pay $5, $10 and even $15 for—are completely passive! They depend strictly on your own will power...

All these ordinary reducing plans give you are HUNGER-APPEASING PRODUCTS—pills, powders and liquids that do nothing more than swell up in your stomach...

So what happened? You struggled to do the job of reducing BY YOURSELF! You pushed away the foods you love. You spent week after week of torture. And finally, if you were lucky, you carved off 5, 10, or even 12 precious pounds.

And then your will power snapped! You broke your terrible diet... And the fat flowed back—heavier and uglier and more deadly than ever before!

[THEN THE SOLUTION:]
These doctors had the answer in a tiny grey pill—and a common-sense plan...
```

**Concentration Can Be Condensed:**
The same effect may be boiled down into two or three sentences, or even a single phrase:
"SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."
Here is contrast—implied weakness in other products—compensating promise in your own.

### THE COMPLETE 13 INTENSIFICATION TECHNIQUES (With Full Examples)

**1. Direct Detailed Description (Your First Presentation)**
Make them SEE, FEEL, TOUCH the product. Put your product in action in the reader's imagination.

**2. Put the Claims in Action**
Show the product working in vivid detail:
```
"And this little Automatic Fish Lure actually swims! Under its own power—crippled-minnow style—up to 5 feet every fifteen seconds! If no fish intercepts it, it will then automatically stop its descent—slowly raise up its nose—and begin its irresistible climb to the surface again!"
```

**3. Bring In the Reader**
Put your reader smack in the middle of the product-in-action story:
```
"Picture this to yourself! Next weekend you go down to your car—the same tired car that you've been driving for years. You've made only one simple change to that car... But now, when you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of engineering science comes to life under your hood!"
```

**4. Show Him How to Test Your Claims**
Turn the demonstration into a test. Let reader visualize himself PROVING the performance:
```
"When you get your set of SA FIRE INJECTORS, here is all you do. If you have an automatic transmission, make a note of how fast your car crawls forward when it is in the drive position, with the motor idling..."
```

**5. Stretch Out Your Benefits in Time**
Show the product at work over weeks and months, a continuous flow of benefits:
```
"First, the amazing English pellets give your plants a tremendous new burst of growth! New plants and old—they send out dozens of hidden shoots and buds! Some of your plants may actually DOUBLE in height and breadth the very first month!
But this is just the beginning! Within one or two short weeks... this amazing pellet AUTOMATICALLY begins the second stage of its work!..."
```

**6. Bring In an Audience**
Other actors provide fresh perspective. May be celebrities (testimonial) or average people (case history):
```
"And then, if you were like the men and women whose fantastic case histories were reported by leading medical journals, perhaps you went to your doctor and asked him for AN EASY WAY OUT—WITHOUT TORTURE..."
```

**7. Show Experts Approving**
The astonishment of experts:
```
"Just picture the astonishment on these experts' faces when in the first month alone, Nearly Wild produced over 15 times more blossoms than the average of all other roses combined..."
```

**8. Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority**
Lay disadvantages of old product side by side with advantages of new:
```
"Yes! While your friends were paying $3.95 for their copies of Frank Yerby's run-away best seller, Dollar Book Club members were getting the same exact book for only 99 cents!"
```

**9. Picture the Black Side, Too (Heaven-Or-Hell)**
Irritate the wound, then apply the salve:
```
"Someday, if you ever have a spare moment, lift one of the old-fashioned spark plugs out of your car! Look at the bottom of that plug... what you'll see is FILTH! The Firing Point of that plug—the most important single point in your car—will be choked, strangled and fouled with BLACK, FILTHY CARBON!"
```

**10. Show How Easy It Is To Get These Benefits**
Stress ease of application, contrasted with tremendous benefits:
```
"One week from today, you are going down to your car. You are going to lift up its hood... and you are going to simply pour its contents into the oil filler pipe of your car!
That's all the work you will do! That's all the skill you need! And yet in that 30 seconds work, you will improve that car's performance in eight different ways!"
```

**11. Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination**
Present facts in more dramatic form outside the rigidly realistic approach:
```
"Suppose he himself were standing forever at your elbow. Every time you mispronounced or misspelled a word... suppose you could hear him whisper, 'That is wrong, it should be thus and so.' In a short time you would habitually use the correct form..."
```

**12. The Catalog (Before You're Done, Summarize)**
Two types:
- Horizontal: Ever-enlargening groups of applications
- Vertical: Deepening/magnifying desire

Example (Horizontal - Blow Torch Kit):
```
ALL IN ONE!
Blow-Torch, Paint-Remover, Soldering Iron!
Does 101 jobs around the house, including—
Laying tile; removing paint or putty; thawing frozen pipes; sweating copper tubing; soldering gutters; repairing electrical work; starting charcoal fires...
```

**13. Put Your Guarantee to Work**
Turn the guarantee into the climax of your ad—the last summary of performances, reinforced at every step:
```
"Guaranteed For Two Full Years!
Yes! You try these amazing POWER FLASH SPARK PLUGS for two full years entirely at our risk! First, test them for one full month for surging power, thrilling new driving performance, breath-taking gas-savings alone!
1. These plugs must give you up to 9 miles more per gallon instantly—or your full purchase price back!
2. These plugs must give you up to 31 more horsepower instantly—or your full purchase price back!
3. These plugs must continue to give you this power, performance and gas savings FOR TWO FULL YEARS—or we will send you a brand-new set ABSOLUTELY FREE!"
```

### EXACT CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING SOPHISTICATION STAGES

**How to Diagnose Stage 1 (Virgin Market):**
- You are FIRST in your market
- No previous information about similar products exists
- Prospects are completely unsophisticated
- Your headline can be simple and direct: just name the need or the claim
- Example: "NOW! LOSE UGLY FAT!"

**How to Diagnose Stage 2 (Second Mover):**
- Direct claim is already being used and still working
- Competition exists but hasn't exhausted claims
- Strategy: Copy the successful claim but ENLARGE it—drive it to absolute limits
- Headlines double and triple in size
- Example: "LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS—OR RECEIVE $40 BACK!"

**Warning Signs of Stage 2 Ending:**
- Enlargement piles on enlargement
- New competitors enter trying to promise more
- Words begin to lose meaning ("whiter-than-whites" appear)
- Prospect becomes confused, then skeptical
- Believability is shattered
- Claims automatically discounted 50% by readers
- Government begins to investigate
- Sales curve begins to turn down

**How to Diagnose Stage 3 (Mechanism Stage):**
- Prospects have heard ALL the claims in ALL their extremes
- Perhaps they've bought one or two competitive products
- Every time they open a newspaper, similar headlines scream at them
- Mere repetition or exaggeration won't work any longer
- Strategy: Shift from WHAT to HOW—introduce a NEW MECHANISM
- The mechanism makes old claims fresh and believable again
- Example: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"

**Structural Change in Stage 3 Ads:**
- In Stage 2: Entire headline = complete statement of main claim; mechanism abbreviated in subhead
- In Stage 3: Mechanism featured IN the headline; claim condensed to shorthand or put in subhead

**How to Diagnose Stage 4 (Mechanism Elaboration):**
- A competitor has just introduced a new mechanism that's producing sales
- Strategy: Elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism
- Make it easier, quicker, surer
- Allow it to solve more of the problem
- Overcome old limitations
- Promise extra benefits
- Example: "FIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!"

**How to Diagnose Stage 5 (Market Exhaustion):**
- Market no longer believes in advertising
- No longer wishes to be aware of your product
- No new mechanism will gain acceptance
- Market is glutted by advertising
- Competitors dropping out en masse
- Field is said to be "exhausted"
- Strategy: Shift from promise and mechanism to IDENTIFICATION with the prospect himself
- Example: "WHY MEN CRACK..."

### LINE-BY-LINE COPY BREAKDOWN: TV REPAIR MANUAL AD

**The Failed Headline (Power-Claim):**
"Save up to $100 a Year on Your TV Repairs!"
Result: Failed to make a profit. The obvious was unsuccessful. Power alone could not move the product.

**Why It Failed:**
- Most prospects thought of themselves as non-handymen
- In 1951, TV set was considered a complicated mechanical monster
- These beliefs BLOCKED the use of the power-claim headline

**The Winning Headline:**
"WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?"

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

**Sentence 1 (Headline):** "WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?"
- No claim. No promise—except disclosure.
- Implication of foul play echoes existing suspicion
- Crystallization of the feeling the average owner felt toward being taken
- FIRST ACCEPTANCE achieved through suspicion

**Sentence 2 (Inclusion Question):** "Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?"
- 95% of television owners would answer Yes
- Builds SECOND ACCEPTANCE
- Starts a HABIT OF AGREEMENT

**Sentence 3 (First Promise):** "Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60 a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you've dreamed about!"

BELIEF-BUILDERS IN THIS SENTENCE:
1. "Then..." ties to previous acceptance—implies exclusion (only for sets after 1947), adds credence
2. Descriptive nature of promise—catalog of almost-universal symptoms (repair bills, service fees) evokes "Yes—I have them" reactions
3. Mechanism deliberately left ambiguous—WHAT you'll save is specific, HOW is not yet revealed (reader not prepared for "making repairs")

**Following Paragraphs (Symptom Reinforcement):**
"How many times this week have you had to get up to fix a jumpy TV picture?... How many times have you had to put up with ghosts?..."
- More "Yes... Yes... Yes" answers
- Habit of acceptance being built
- Trust forming layer by layer

**The Goal Conclusion Build (Dependability):**
"90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!"
"These sets have been subjected to 'Breakdown Tests' that would seem incredible to the average owner. They have been turned on for 24 hours a day—7 days a week—4 weeks a month. Some of these sets have been running without a moment's pause for as much as 17 months."

**The Turn (Critical Transition):**
"And most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance out of your set!"

FOUR BELIEF-BUILDERS IN THIS TRANSITION:
1. Paragraph parallelism—framed as last of similar paragraphs already accepted
2. Lead word "And"—tie-in phrase indicating same as before
3. "most important"—implies remainder is part of series that went before
4. "these experts have discovered"—echoes identifying subhead

**The Redefinition:**
- "Repairs" redefined as "adjustments"
- Troubles redefined as "warning signals" or "symptoms"
- "Repair calls" or "breakdowns" segregated into least-likely-to-occur 5% of troubles

**Final Syllogism:**
"It's as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge. If you had that knowledge yourself—then you would not have to pay him at all."

### SPECIFIC NUMBERS, PERCENTAGES, AND FORMULAS FROM THE BOOK

**The Amplification Effect:**
- $1 spent on advertising exploiting existing desire can create $50 or even $100 in sales

**Headline Space Reality:**
- Your headline represents only 10%-20% of the total physical space of your ad
- Attempting to do the full selling job in the headline is "to shoot craps with your client's money"

**Believability Discount:**
- In late Stage 2 markets, claims are automatically discounted 50% by readers

**TV Repair Statistics Used:**
- About 80% of TV repairs were simple enough for owner to make
- Test sets ran for 17 months without pause
- Service contracts cost $30-$60/year
- Individual repairs cost $15-$20

**The "One Fully-Believed Promise" Formula:**
- One fully-believed promise has TEN TIMES the sales power of ten partially-believed promises

**The Three Dimensions of Mass Desire:**
1. Urgency, intensity, degree of demand to be satisfied
2. Staying power, degree of repetition, inability to become satiated
3. Scope—the number of people who share this desire

**Campaign Intensification Math:**
- In emotional writing, 1 + 1 can often equal 10
- Two emotional images joined correctly can have TEN TIMES the impact of either alone

**Format Adaptation Impact:**
- A single change in format (matching publication style) can add 50% to readership and results

**Rose Test Statistics:**
- Nearly Wild produced 15x more blossoms than average of all other roses combined
- In July: 50 new roses a day, 7x more than second leading rose
- In August: 21x more than nearest competitor

**Spark Plug Promises:**
- Up to 9 miles more per gallon
- Up to 31 more horsepower
- 4-6 miles per hour faster at idle
- Up to 200 more RPM at idling
- Up to 300 more RPM at high speeds

---

### THE "CAMOUFLAGE" TECHNIQUE (Borrowing Believability)

**Three Methods:**

**1. Format Adaptation**
Match the exact format of the publication:
- Use their headline-to-body-copy transition
- Use their illustrations, subheads, break-up of space
- Let them set your ad in their type

Example: Wall Street Journal ad repeated 19 times monthly with no drop-off because:
- Headline set in Journal type (old-fashioned, upper-and-lower-case)
- Two subheadlines following directly on each other (very 19th century)
- Two bars above and below first subhead
- Subheads placed to extreme left of column
- Line drawing instead of photograph (Journal doesn't use photos)

**2. Phraseology Adaptation**
Adopt the news format and news phraseology:
```
SKIN SPECIALIST DEMONSTRATES
HOW TO RINSE AWAY YOUR BLACKHEADS
By Claire Hoffman
New York, N.Y.—A leading doctor today showed an audience of men, women and skin-troubled teenagers how to clean oily skin...
```

**3. Mood Adaptation**

**Understatement/Simplicity:**
- Fewer adjectives than expected
- No superlatives
- Short sentences that fall rather than rise in tone
- Example: Volkswagen ads

**Deadly Sincerity:**
- Leaning over backwards to point out flaws
- Benefits become more believable by contrast
```
"This is John Horn's first book. He is not an accomplished writer, and it has flaws. If you read for style, or for literary quality, this is not your book.
But there are paragraphs in this book—ideas in this book—whole chapters in this book that have never been put down on paper before!"
```

---

### THE "REDEFINITION" TECHNIQUE - Full Detail

**Three Categories of Product Drawback:**
1. Too complicated—too hard to use
2. Not important enough—basic appeal doesn't have statistically broad enough market
3. Costs too much—price above competitive products

**Classic Redefinition Example (Lifebuoy):**
- Problem: Horrible medicinal odor
- Solution: Redefine the odor from liability to asset
- The B.O. campaign focused on BODY odor (which does drive people away)
- The medicinal odor became PROOF of odor-destroying power
- Complete reversal—liability becomes asset with a single idea

**Simplification Redefinition (TV Repair Manual):**
1. Compare TV set to human body—"warning signals" like a running nose before a cold
2. Continuously describe minor maladjustments as "warning signals" and "symptoms" rather than "breakdowns"
3. State outright that corrections can be made "on the outside controls of your set"

Result:
- "Repairs" redefined as "adjustments"
- "Troubles" redefined as "warning signals"
- "Breakdowns" segregated into unlikely 5%

**Escalation Redefinition (Importance Building):**
When product appeal isn't broad enough, escalate the importance.

**Price Reduction Redefinition:**
Use mechanism to justify the price cut. Without justification, you get only a fraction of real sales power.

**Key Insight:**
Notice how similar Gradualization and Redefinition are:
- Gradualization operates by its STRUCTURE—arrangement of facts and phrases
- Redefinition operates by its rearrangement of PERSPECTIVE

---

### VERIFICATION, REINFORCEMENT, AND INTERWEAVING

**Verification Rule:**
Proof—like claims—is most effective when the reader unconsciously DEMANDS it, and when he is ready to accept its content as necessary and logical.

**Documentation Placement:**
- Stop thinking of placing documentation only in headline, subhead, or separate "Proof" box
- Interweave it throughout copy—combined with promises, belief-words, momentum-builders, image-sharpeners, emotion-definers

**Reinforcement Principle:**
In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal TEN:
- Two emotional images joined correctly have TEN TIMES the impact of either alone
- Creativity = ability to combine separate images into a new unity much more powerful than the logical sum of its parts

**Example (Avis):**
- Image 1: "We try harder"
- Image 2: "We're only second"
- Combined impact far exceeds what either achieves alone

---

### THE SEVEN TECHNIQUES OF BREAKTHROUGH ADVERTISING (Complete List)

1. **INTENSIFICATION** - Building desire by presenting continually new images of satisfaction
2. **IDENTIFICATION** - Building a saleable personality into your product; the roles your prospect desires
3. **GRADUALIZATION** - Making your prospect believe your claims before you state them; the architecture of belief
4. **REDEFINITION** - Removing objections to your product; simplification, escalation, price reduction
5. **MECHANIZATION** - Verbally proving that your product does what you claim; the three stages of mechanism
6. **CONCENTRATION** - Destroying alternate ways for your prospect to satisfy his desire; direct attack
7. **CAMOUFLAGE** - Borrowing conviction for your copy; format, phraseology, and mood adaptation

**How They Work Together:**
- Intensification shows the penalties of continuing with the old product
- Gradualization shows the logical cause of weaknesses and how they can be cured
- Mechanization proves your product removes the weakness
- Concentration combines almost every technique in the book
- Position increases power—we find new examples of this every time we explore another copy process
