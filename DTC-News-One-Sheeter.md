## The Engine (3 Pillars)

### 1. Content Intelligence
Scrapes Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Amazon. Finds what's actually working right now.
- **Outlier scoring** — surfaces 3x-7x viral performers
- **Deduplication** — never repeat content
- **Virality analysis** — tells you WHY it worked

### 2. Newsletter Generation
5-section format proven to convert:
| Section | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Instant Reward | Hook them in 3 seconds | 30-60 words |
| What's Working Now | THE MEAT — tactical value | 300-500 words |
| The Breakdown | Story-sell bridge | 200-300 words |
| Tool of the Week | Monetization moment | 100-200 words |
| PS Statement | Keep them wanting more | 20-40 words |

### 3. Product Factory
Turns pain points into products:
```
python -m execution.product_factory --discover   # Find real problems
python -m execution.product_factory --create     # Build solutions
```
**Output:** Ready-to-sell digital products ($17-$97) with sales copy included.

## Why It Works

1. **Real data, not guessing** — Content comes from actual engagement metrics
2. **28 anti-patterns blocked** — No "game-changer," "unlock potential," or AI slop
3. **Voice-locked** — Every output sounds like a human wrote it
4. **Self-improving** — When something works, it becomes a saved directive
